# Quadratic_Eqn_Root_Finder
This is a program based on PYTHON which would help you to find the roots/zeroes of a Quadratic Equation. 
It is not that much advanced but ya , it can help you to solve basic questions.
limitations:-
(a) Always gives answers in decimal values.
(b) Can't process under root values.
I WILL TRY TO IMPROVE IT
